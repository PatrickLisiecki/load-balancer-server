# Backend Server for Load Balancer

The purpose of this repo is to provide a backend server for the load balancer. The code for the load balancer can be found [here](https://github.com/PatrickLisiecki/load-balancer). In the ```server.js``` file there is a ```_health``` endpoint for checking if the server is responsive and a default ```/``` endpoint.
